# Covid Cases Tracker

Super simple website that tracks the covid cases in India.
Dataset has been taken from Covid19India, which is a public dataset.

Still working on creating charts using Chart.Js libraries.

Made in HTML, CSS and JS.

Site can be found here: https://suryanelakanti.github.io/covidcases_tracker/
